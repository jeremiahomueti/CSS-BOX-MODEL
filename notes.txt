THE CSS BOX MODEL 

It's the idea that everythin in CSS is a BOX
...and those boxes have thier peculiar properties. 


If you observe the boxes perimeterizing every object in a web
page, from the inspect view, you'll notice that each box 
has different colours. Some boxes have blue, some orange, 
some green. And those different colours mean different things.
